## Project Information

- Name: yarn-plugin-auto-install
- Description: A yarn (berry) plugin for running `yarn install` automatically.
- Package Manager: yarn

## General Instructions

- After making code changes, run `yarn check-all-for-ai` to execute all tests (note: this may take up to 30 minutes), or run `yarn check-for-ai` for type checking and linting only.
  - If you are confident your changes will not break any tests, you may use `check-for-ai`.
- Once you have verified your changes, commit them to the current branch using the `--no-verify` option and push to the current branch.
  - Follow conventional commits, i.e., your commit message should start with `feat:`, `fix:`, etc.
  - Make sure to add a new line at the end of your commit message with: `Co-authored-by: WillBooster (Claude Code) <agent@willbooster.com>`.
  - Always create new commits. Avoid using `--amend`.

## Coding Style

- Write comments that explain "why" rather than "what". Avoid explanations that can be understood from the code itself.
- Use stderr for logging debug messages temporarily since stdout output is sometimes omitted.
- When adding new functions or classes, define them below any functions or classes that call them to maintain clear call order.
